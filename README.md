# README
Deploying an __AWS__ built in algorithm.


I took the example from: 

https://github.com/krishnaik06/AWS-SageMaker/blob/master/Untitled2.ipynb

And updated it using:

+ https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html

+ https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/sagemaker.html#client


Running everything on AWS from local jupyter notebook.

Requirements:

+ `sagemaker`==2.29.0
